Based on your inventory, your apps can be categorized into several key themes: educational primers (e.g., Bayesian Primer, Evolutionary Psychology Primer), productivity & utility tools (e.g., Eat the Frog, Conversion Calculators), AI/LLM-focused applications (e.g., Prompt Generator, LLM Study Guide), and guides & resource collections (e.g., macOS Shortcuts, Arizona Plants Guide). Your app descriptions also highlight a preference for interactive user interfaces and self-contained HTML files.
Here are 30 suggestions for similar apps, focusing on these themes and design principles.
