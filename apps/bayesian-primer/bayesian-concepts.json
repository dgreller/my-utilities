          "content": "<p>Bayesian inference is a statistical method rooted in the principle of updating beliefs in light of new evidence. At its core, it reallocates credibility to different possibilities as more data becomes available. Unlike traditional frequentist methods, which treat probabilities as long-run frequencies of events, Bayesianism defines probability as a 'degree of belief' or confidence in a hypothesis. This subjective yet structured approach allows for a more intuitive handling of uncertainty and is applicable to a wide range of problems where data may be limited, and prior knowledge is valuable.</p>"

          "id": "history",
          "content": "<p>The foundational concepts of Bayesian theory were developed by the Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English minister and mathematician. His work, 'An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances,' was presented to the Royal Society in 1763, after his death. While Bayes laid the groundwork, it was the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace who independently developed and greatly popularized the theorem, applying it to complex problems in celestial mechanics, medical statistics, and even law. Despite its early origins, Bayesian methods only gained widespread use in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful computers capable of handling the often-intensive calculations.</p>"

          "content": "<ul><li><strong>Interpretation of Probability:</strong> A frequentist defines probability as the long-run frequency of an event over repeated trials (e.g., the probability of a coin landing heads is 50% because it would do so in half of an infinite number of flips). A Bayesian, on the other hand, views probability as a degree of confidence in a statement, which can be updated as new evidence comes to light.</li><li><strong>Model Parameters:</strong> In frequentist statistics, model parameters are considered fixed, unknown constants that we aim to estimate. In the Bayesian framework, parameters are treated as random variables, having their own probability distributions that represent our uncertainty about them.</li><li><strong>Inference:</strong> Frequentist inference often relies on p-values and confidence intervals, which can be unintuitive (a 95% confidence interval does not mean there is a 95% probability the true parameter is in the interval). Bayesian inference results in posterior distributions and credible intervals, which offer a more direct probabilistic statement about the parameter (e.g., 'there is a 95% probability the true parameter value is in this interval').</li></ul>"

          "content": "<p>The interplay between these three components is the engine of Bayesian reasoning. We start with a <strong>prior</strong> belief about a parameter. Then, we collect data and calculate the <strong>likelihood</strong> of this data under different parameter values. Finally, we combine the prior and the likelihood using Bayes' theorem to obtain the <strong>posterior</strong> distribution. This posterior is a blend of our prior knowledge and the information from the data, representing our new, updated belief. A key feature of this process is that today's posterior can become tomorrow's prior as new data is collected, allowing for sequential learning.</p>"

This direct probabilistic interpretation is a significant advantage over the frequentist confidence interval, which has a more convoluted definition related to long-run performance of the interval estimation procedure, not the specific interval calculated from a given sample.</p>"

A frequentist approach might end with a p-value, such as p < 0.05, which is often misinterpreted. A Bayesian approach, however, can provide a more direct answer, such as, 'There is a 98% probability that version B is better than version A,' and even estimate the magnitude of the improvement. This allows stakeholders to make decisions based on the probability of success and potential ROI, rather than just an abstract statistical threshold.</p>"

A test for this disease is 99% accurate (it correctly identifies 99% of people who have it and correctly identifies 99% of people who don't). If you test positive, what is the probability you actually have the disease? Intuitively, one might think it's 99%. However, using Bayes' theorem, the actual probability is only about 9%. This is because the number of false positives (1% of the 999 healthy people) is much larger than the number of true positives (99% of the 1 sick person). Bayesian reasoning helps to correctly calibrate our intuition in the face of such counter-intuitive results.</p>"

When a new email arrives, the filter uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the email is spam given the words it contains. The filter's beliefs are continuously updated with every new email it processes and every time a user marks an email as spam, making it an adaptive learning system.</p>"

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a class of algorithms that allow us to approximate these complex distributions by drawing a sequence of random samples. Algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target posterior. By running the chain for a long time, the collected samples can be used to estimate the shape and properties of the posterior, making complex Bayesian modeling feasible.</p>"

They consist of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent variables and edges represent conditional dependencies.

Given a set of observed symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of various diseases, providing a powerful tool for reasoning under uncertainty in fields like artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and risk analysis.</p>"

          "content": "<p>A conjugate prior is a type of prior distribution that, when combined with the likelihood, results in a posterior distribution that belongs to the same family of distributions as the prior. This is a matter of mathematical convenience, as it allows for a simple, analytical update of the posterior without resorting to numerical methods like MCMC. For instance, the Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli likelihood. If our prior belief about the probability of a coin landing heads is described by a Beta distribution, and our data (the coin flips) follows a Bernoulli distribution, then our posterior belief will also be a Beta distribution, just with updated parameters. While not always applicable, using conjugate priors when appropriate can greatly simplify Bayesian calculations.</p>"
