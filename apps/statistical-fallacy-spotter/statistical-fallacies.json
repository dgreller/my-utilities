This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics and is particularly confounding when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations. For example, a drug might appear to be effective for both men and women when analyzed separately, but when the data is combined, it may appear to be ineffective or even harmful.",

The term is used to illustrate how incorrect stimulation in economics and politics can cause unintended consequences. It is named after an anecdote set in the time of British rule of colonial India. The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free.",

The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. The second step is to disregard that which can't be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can't be easily measured really doesn't exist. This is suicide.",

It is a common statistical phenomenon that can be mistaken for a causal effect. For example, a student who scores very high on a test is likely to score lower on the next test, and a student who scores very low is likely to score higher. This is not because of any change in their ability, but because their first score was likely affected by luck.",

From this reasoning, a false conclusion is inferred. This fallacy is the philosophical/rhetorical application of the multiple comparisons problem (in statistics) and apophenia (in psychology). It is related to the clustering illusion; people have a tendency to under-predict the amount of structure that will appear in random data. The name comes from a joke about a Texan who fires some gunshots at the side of a barn, then paints a target centered on the tightest cluster of hits and claims to be a sharpshooter.",

If presented with related base rate information (i.e., general statistical information) and specific information (i.e., information pertaining only to a certain case), the mind tends to ignore the former and focus on the latter. For example, if you are told that a certain test for a disease is 99% accurate, and you test positive, you might think you have a 99% chance of having the disease.
